INTRODUCTION
-------------------------------------
 This README is for use with Project 1 of UDACITY Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree and will show the reader how to install Python if needed, as well as how to download, unzip, and run the Python script for Project 1.
 
INSTALLATION OF PYTHON
-------------------------------------
 We will be using Pythong v2.7.9 for this Project so please ensure you have it installed. If you already do - you can skip this step. If you are not sure, or want to reinstall please continue.
 
 1. Navigate to the Python webpage via your browser. The link is: http://python.org/downloads
 2. Select Python v2.7.9 and click to download whichever version you'd like (specifically around 32 vs 64 bit options due to your preference / machine). 
 3. After download is complete - launch the installer.
 4. During the wizard ensure you select ALL options to be installed (including adding Python to PATH).
 5. You're all set installing Python.
 
HOW TO RUN THE PYTHON PROJECT SCRIPT
-------------------------------------
 Now that you have Python running on your machine. Let continue by running our Project!
 
 1. Unzip the Project to any location of your choice on your machine.
 2. Navigate to the file location which you unziped the Project files.
 3. Open the folder "Project 1"
 4. You can view the files individually here if you'd like to take a look at the code directly, but to run the project Right-Click on "entertainment_center.py" and select "Edit in IDLE".
 5. When IDLE opens, hit F5 - OR - select "Run", then "Run Module".
    IDLE will now lauch the compiler, build the HTML page, and open it in your browser (the HTML file is created within the folder the files were located).
 6. You have launched Project 1!
